Description:
    We are making a simulation game. For the moment, we will make a market tycoon game cause that sounds fun. or like a company simulator where you have a good that you can make. You can make your own products and set a certain price as well as COGS to it. More products, more infrastructure to make the product and sell it and you can add different teams like marketing teams and manfacturing teams but they come with costs and you can even assign customization to personell and wages for employees while receiving a customer base and revenue to suplement your funds. You can even do different company types for starting out like starting out as a corporate entity or as a startup entreprenuer in a certain industry where the larger the industry the more competition but more potential for revenue. End game would be mataining the company and reward of milestones and you can set it where the end game could change if preferred like total war where you may win by hitting a certain dollar amount in market cap or by obtaining a certain market share with a particular product line or bla bla blah... Good start I think, but KISS for now.

    KISS

    - Game Win/Fail
    - Overview

Sub:
    - Improvement

In Progress:
    - Able to clear the output of the command line history?
    - Expand buy items for buildings which is a multipler depending on type of building (option for manufacturing making cost cheaper for each new product, marketing for multiplicity of each product, administration building to expand limit of amount of buildings able to be purchased, sales building to adjust amount of revenue of each product). Each building has a size option that bigger the size, more expensive it is but more value from it. Each building has a certain amount of employees with salaries of each person and
    - Baseline of employee creation of certain stats (morale impacting amount of operational efficiency, skill being a output multiplier but has increased cost overall for the employee, ...)
    - Baseline of building creation of certain stats (amount of employees, operating efficiency based on size (smaller buildings will have an increased operational efficiency while larger buildings wont but produce more output in general), ...)
    - Baseline of product creation of certain stats (amount of customers, max of dollar amount that product can increase your revenue by based on what the type is and the indsutry its in, ...)
    - Make bigger product options w/increase money increment per loop and cost loop dependent of product type

    - Refactor the buy and sell into functions and products into classes (or functions to start?)
    - Need a end game......and a turn counter
