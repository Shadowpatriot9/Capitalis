# Capitalis

## Introduction
This is a turn-based business tycoon game via a CLI developed in C++. It's mainly a project for me to continue development as consistent as I can get it on a daily basis, but you know; it's a game at the end of the day, so just have at it :)

## Installation
1. Clone repo
```
git clone https://github.com/Shadowpatriot9/Capitalis.git
```
2. Build C++ application via an IDE comptabile (Xcode, VS Code w/clang)
3. Run 'main.exe' from build

## How to Play
Once the game is open in a CLI, most of the prompts will take you through each turn, but couple things to go over.

### Win:
The goal of the game is achieve a certain dollar amount in your 'Current Money' amount. Once achieved, the game ends and you win.

### Lose:
You lose the game when a new turn starts and you have nothing left in your 'Current Money.' That's it; plain and simple.

### Turn Actions:
Each turn, you can do two main things; buy or sell.
Things you can buy are:
- Products (this will increase your 'Current Money' per turn depending on the product type)
- Buildings (this will increase your product's by acting as: multipliers, cost reducers, etc... depending on the building purchased)
- Staff (tbd)

_I'll go over more about it later, but that's the gist of it for the moment. I'm adding more as I go too, so this will be changing quite a bit._
