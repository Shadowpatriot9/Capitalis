Bugs:
    - bought product to be included in overview menu list of products
    - think need to clean the code a bit overall after you create a building object and a basic sell function for something
    - Create building array and fix output results similar to product buys

In Progress (v1.0):
    - Make building bought menu to per turn
    - Need better input handling for selectors to initiate game
    - Able to clear the output of the command line history?
    - Financing options like small loans w/strong interest and based on if you are eligibile to based on the indsutry and overall likelihood you would success, or borrow from family but dollar amount is small and still up to chance, or stuff like grants or angel investing based on a probability stat of a presentation (like a mini game like you are asked a question and have to select the right one as if an investor was trying to see if they trust you based on how you answer the question but there are like 5 different questions with varying topics like mgmt ability, selling ability, etc...)
    - Start the game out with $0
    - Adjust overview menu to include all revenue and expenses per turn (or just overall function for per turn actions or display?)
    - Expand buy items for buildings which is a multipler depending on type of building (option for manufacturing making cost cheaper for each new product, marketing for multiplicity of demographic (or something), administration building to expand limit of amount of buildings able to be purchased, sales building to adjust amount of revenue of each product). Each building has a size option that bigger the size, more expensive it is but more value from it. Each building has a certain amount of employees with salaries of each person and
    - Baseline of employee creation of certain stats (morale impacting amount of operational efficiency, skill being a output multiplier but has increased cost overall for the employee, ...)
    - Baseline of building creation of certain stats (amount of employees, operating efficiency based on size (smaller buildings will have an increased operational efficiency while larger buildings wont but produce more output in general), ...)
    - Baseline of product creation of certain stats (amount of customers, max of dollar amount that product can increase your revenue by based on what the type is and the indsutry its in, ...)
    - Make bigger product options w/increase money increment per loop and cost loop dependent of product type
 
In Progress (v1.1):
    - Random event spawner (like recession lose x amount of money, union formation due to neglect lose x amount of staff or buildings until x amount of money repaid to settle strike, etc...)
    
Done (v1.0):
    - Make a product menu of what you currently own and incremental purchase of products
    - Add lines in between menus
    - Refactor the buy and sell into functions and products into classes (or functions to start?)
    - Need a end game......and a turn counter
